	decompose individual return skewness into a systematic component
	and an idiosyncratic component. Empirical analysis of OEX options
	and 30 stocks demonstrates that individual risk-neutral distributions
	differ from that of the market index by being far less negatively
	skewed. This article explains the presence and evolution of risk-neutral
	skewness over time and in the cross section of individual stocks.},

	Finally, we document the fact that the skewness risk premium fills
	the time gap between one quarter ahead predictability, delivered
	by the variance risk premium as a short term predictor of excess
	returns and traditional long term predictors such as price-dividend
	or price-earning ratios. Our results are supported by a simple equilibrium

  abstract = {If a problem in functional data analysis is low dimensional then the
	methodology for its solution can often be reduced to relatively conventional
	techniques in multivariate analysis. Hence, there is intrinsic interest
	in assessing the finite dimensionality of functional data. We show
	that this problem has several unique features. From some viewpoints
	the problem is trivial, in the sense that continuously distributed
	functional data which are exactly finite dimensional are immediately
	recognizable as such, if the sample size is sufficiently large. However,
	in practice, functional data are almost always observed with noise,
	for example, resulting from rounding or experimental error. Then
	the problem is almost insolubly difficult. In such cases a part of
	the average noise variance is confounded with the true signal and
	is not identifiable. However, it is possible to define the unconfounded
	part of the noise variance. This represents the best possible lower
	bound to all potential values of average noise variance and is estimable
	in low noise settings. Moreover, bootstrap methods can be used to
	describe the reliability of estimates of unconfounded noise variance,
	under the assumption that the signal is finite dimensional. Motivated
	by these ideas, we suggest techniques for assessing the finiteness
	of dimensionality. In particular, we show how to construct a critical
	point <formula format=\&quot;inline\&quot;><file name=\&quot;rssb_562_mu1.gif\&quot;
	type=\&quot;gif\&quot; /></formula> such that, if the distribution
	of our functional data has fewer than \&quot;q\&quot; - 1 degrees
	of freedom, then we should be willing to assume that the average
	variance of the added noise is at least <formula format=\&quot;inline\&quot;><file
	name=\&quot;rssb_562_mu2.gif\&quot; type=\&quot;gif\&quot; /></formula>.
	If this level seems too high then we must conclude that the dimension
	is at least \&quot;q\&quot; - 1. We show that simpler, more conventional
	techniques, based on hypothesis testing, are gene},

	risk-neutral moments (variance, skewness, and kurtosis) for individual
	stocks from various perspectives. We first show that it is in the
	estimation of the higher moments essential to use an interpolation
	with a narrow grid as well as a wide interval. We show that implied
	moments are well explained cross-sectionally by a number of firm
	characteristics. We use the characteristics that have been shown
	to exhibit correlation with expected returns (like size and the market-to-book
	ratio of equity). In a next step, we investigate the joint dynamics
	of the three moments in a vector autoregressive model. We find that
	the moments are significantly linked to each other over time. Finally,
	adding exogenous variables to the vector autoregression improves
	the explanatory power of our model even further. Granger causality
	tests show significant differences between the three implied moments.},

	is an element of â€‰R-super-"d",â€‰"d"=1,â€‰2, difference-based estimators
	have been investigated in a series of papers. For a given length
	of such an estimator, difference schemes which minimize the asymptotic
	mean-squared error can be computed for "d"=1 and "d"=2. However,
	from numerical studies it is known that for finite sample sizes the
	performance of these estimators may be deficient owing to a large
	finite sample bias. We provide theoretical support for these findings.
	In particular, we show that with increasing dimension "d" this becomes
	more drastic. If "d"â©¾4, these estimators even fail to be consistent.
	A different class of estimators is discussed which allow better control
	of the bias and remain consistent when "d"â©¾4. These estimators
	are compared numerically with kernel-type estimators (which are asymptotically
	efficient), and some guidance is given about when their use becomes

  abstract = {Using data on individual stock options, we show that the currently
	observed option-implied ex ante skewness is positively related to
	future stock returns. This contrasts with the existing evidence that
	uses historical stock or option data to estimate skewness and finds
	a negative skewness-return relation. We proxy for the ex ante skewness
	by using the model-free implied skewness (MFIS) and show that high
	MFIS stocks outperform low MFIS stocks by 45 basis points per month
	after correcting for systematic exposure. We find that the positive
	MFIS-return relation stems from the ability of the current MFIS to
	identify the deviation of a firm’s value from its fundamental value,
	and the most overvalued stocks have the most negative ex ante skewness.
	We further find that the speed of the value correction process depends
	on the arbitrage risk faced by arbitrageurs trying to exploit the
	observed inefficiencies. Our results have implications for the segmentation
	of equity and options markets as well as for limits of arbitrage
	in equity markets.},

	density. These cumulants capture the risk-averse behavior of investors
	in the stock and option markets for bearing the investment risk that
	is reflected in the deviations of the implied risk-neutral distribution
	from the normal distribution. We show that the bias of implied volatility
	to forecast its corresponding physical measure can be eliminated
	when the implied volatility regressions are adjusted for risk premium
	effects. The latter are captured mainly by the third-order risk-neutral
	cumulant. We also show that a substantial reduction of higher order

  abstract = { This study documents a positive relationship between the option-implied
	risk-neutral skewness (RNS) of individual stock returns’ distribution
	and future realized stock returns during the period 1996–2012. A
	strategy that goes long the quintile portfolio with the highest RNS
	stocks and short the quintile portfolio with the lowest RNS stocks
	yields a Fama–French–Carhart alpha of 55 basis points per month (t-statistic
	of 2.47). The significant underperformance of the portfolio with
	the most negative RNS stocks is driven by those stocks that are also
	perceived as relatively overpriced according to a series of overvaluation
	proxies and are too costly or too risky to sell short, thereby hindering
	the price correction mechanism. Our findings indicate that a highly
	negative RNS value, when reflecting high hedging demand for options
	by investors who perceive the underlying stock as relatively overpriced
	but hard to sell short, is a robust signal of significant future
	stock underperformance. This paper was accepted by Jerome Detemple,
